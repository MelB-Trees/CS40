/* What has been implemented correctly:

 *          The program correctly implements readfile and correctly
 *          identifies the original rows from the corrupted file
 *          (with one exception). 
 *
 * 
 */ 

/* What is still missing:

 *          Our program hasn't been programmed to handle char infusions
 *          containing a '/0' char in the middle, and prematurely
 *          finished processing the line.
 * 
 *          To ammeliorate this, the program will throw an uncaught
 *          exception if the length of the rows generated for the original
 *          file are different, which implies the presence of
 *          this '/0' char.

/* Time spent:
 *
 *      At least 20 hours
